# 200~This portfolio represents my personal evolution in JavaScript. So that I can constantly watch my mistakes and learn from them. But, you can also find here a lot of interesting content geared towards algorithms and data structure. Application of calculations and complex computational exercises. Many of them inspired by the things I learned with java and have been trying to adapt to javascript. Obviously I will try to bring the best program I can, but as I develop my code evolves, and as my code evolves I will also evolve, and I will keep learning recursively.
